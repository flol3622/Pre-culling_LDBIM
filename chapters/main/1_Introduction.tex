From 2D, to 3D and now to \acs{bim}. The evolution of the \ac{aec} industry has been a long and complex one. The introduction of 3D modeling was the first major step in the industry's evolution, as it allowed for more accurate representations of buildings. No longer solely relying on 2D drawings, a 3D model of a building can be used to create various representations, from a simple 2D floor plan to a complete 3D model. Following the adoption of 3D modeling, the implementation of \ac{bim} emerged as another significant milestone. \ac{bim} adds an extra layer of information on top of the standard 3D model. As the digital representation of a building's physical and functional characteristics, BIM serves as a repository for semantics originating from various applications throughout the design and construction processes, including cost estimation, energy analysis, and production planning.

\label{sec:intro}
However, as mentioned in \cite{Werbrouck2018}, the next challenge for the \ac{aec} industry is related to the domain-specific nature of current \ac{bim} softwares, which remains closed off to other disciplines. This data management challenge is currently being adressed by the \ac{lbd-cg} and other research entities, such as the University of Ghent, through the use of Web of Data technologies \footcite{ldbimGroup}. This emerging milestone will be discussed in this thesis under the term \ac{ldbim}.

\section{Proposal} \label{sec:proposal}
Each of these evolutions has brought, and will continue to bring, a significant amount of data together. The volume of data is expected to grow exponentially in the future as the industry shifts towards a more digital approach, and opens up to other stakeholders. The data graphs will not only expand in terms of semantics, but also in geometry. The growing size of the graph makes visual querying, or simply put, 3D exploration of models, an increasingly difficult task. In particular the newer devices used in the industry, such as phones and tablets. Even though these devices have become more powerful over the years, they still lack the computational resources of traditional office computers.

To visualize the amount of geometric data, Table \ref{tab:sizeModels} shows the size of the test-models used in \cite{Johansson2015}. This study, conducted in 2015, focused on the performance of \ac{bim} viewers for large models. It used the following description in regards to the large models:

These models demonstrate how basic \ac{bim} models can already contain a significant amount of data. \ac{ldbim} will not only bring together new stakeholders, but also be able to keep track of multiple geometry versions of each object, should they occur. Therefore, this thesis proposes a new approach to the visual querying of \ac{ldbim} models, wherein viewers will not have to load the entire model into memory. As existing visualisation techniques encounter processing limitations when the scene continues to expand in size, particularly when managing non-active parts of the scene, which are stored in the \ac{ram}. Instead, after filtering at the source, only the geometry needed for the visual tasks at hand will be loaded, while maintaining the original link to each resource for further processing and use cases. This filtering step is commonly referred to as culling in the computer graphics industry and is illustrated in Figure\ref{fig:cullingPrinciple}.

Figure \ref{fig:cullingPrinciple} showcases multiple culling techniques to elaborate on some culling principles. The first technique, \textbf{frustum culling}, is used to determine which objects are visible to the user. The second technique, \textbf{occlusion culling}, is used to determine which objects are occluded by or behind other objects. And lastly, \textbf{back-face culling} is used to determine which faces, instead of whole objects, are facing away from the user.

Figure \ref{fig:firstIdea} illustrates the basic idea of this thesis, presenting an extra step in the communication between a user, represented here by a \ac{hhd}, and a database that houses the model. An \ac{hhd} has been chosen to exemplify a low-powered device used in the field, which requires a lightweight 3D viewer to visualize and explore the digital twin of the building. The \ac{hhd} is assumed to have no knowledge of the \ac{ldbim} model and only receives the geometry that needs to be displayed from the database. On the other hand, the database is assumed to possess, or have access to, all the knowledge of the model and the necessary semantics to perform the culling.

\section{Research questions}\label{sec:researchQuestions}
This thesis proposes the introduction of culling algorithm technology within the context of \ac{ldbim}, to address the previously mentioned issue of the scene's size, by culling the scene at its source prior to sending it to the viewer. As culling algorithms have been extensively researched and continue to evolve, as is described in section \ref{sec:historyCulling}, the research questions in this thesis concentrate on assessing the feasibility of introducing such algorithms to \ac{ldbim}. It aims to propose a set of possible solutions tailored to the problems a 3D viewer would encounter upon receiving and handling a complete 3D model, while highlighting possibilities for future research and specific use cases.

\subsection[Can \acs{ldbim} be culled?]{To what extent can \acs{ldbim} geometry be culled \\
	to be streamed to lightweight viewers?} \label{subsec:rq1}
In other words, what constitutes the smallest triples (Section \ref{subsec:rdfAndTriples}) or snippets of data required by the viewer and culling algorithms? This question will be addressed by examining possible culling algorithms, their applicability to \ac{ldbim} models, and a hands-on approach to the development of a prototype. This exploration will extend this research question to the implementation of secondary parameters, both from a culling perspective, such as special filters, and from a visual standpoint, such as the visualization of semantics related to each object.

\subsection[Can existing semantics be used?]{Can existing semantics and ontologies be used\\
	to feed possible culling algorithms?}\label{subsec:rq2}
Unlike the computer graphics industry, this interconnected context already includes both explicit and implicit relationships within the data graph, the latter being derived through inferencing (Section \ref{subsec:ontologies}). This is similar to the work of \cite{Johansson2009}. In their paper, they utilized the semantics of a \ac{bim} model in an \ac{ifc} format to develop culling techniques. In contrast, this thesis will focus on the use of Semantic Web resources. As such, it will examine both \ac{aec}-specific and \ac{aec}-related ontologies, such as those related to \ac{gis}, to determine if they can be employed to feed culling algorithms.
