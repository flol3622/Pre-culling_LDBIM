\chapter{Modular Approach} \label{ch:modularApproach}
% - what is a modular approach
% - why is it important
%   - extendability
%   - maintainability
%   - reusability
% - all modules in basic form
%   - always imrpoovements possible
% - access != modules to rest
% - both specific to culling as to LDBIM viewers in general
% - knowledge was mined from prototype
The theoretical model proposed in this thesis is informed by the practical experiences and observations gained through the development of the prototype.

\section{Data fetching}
% - what I mean by that

\subsection{\acs{sparql} fetcher}
% - handles back and forth communication with rdf database
% - authentication

\subsection{Database fetcher}
% - handles back and forth communication with external database
% - authentication

\section{Cache manager}
% - what I mean by that
% - why is it important
%   - performance
%   - data integrity
% - multitidude of possibilities, such as LRU
% - why not others

\subsection{\acs{lru} algorithm}
% - LRU principle
% - develop needs

\section{Query processing}
% - multiple sources

\subsection{Query builder}
% - challenges that come with it
% - abstraction of dynamic queries in algorithms, 

\subsection{Query composer}
% - combination af multiple queries

\section{Interactions} \label{sec:interactions}
% - diagram + explanations

\section{Sequences}
