{\huge\sffamily{Preface}}

This thesis is the result of research about \ac{ar} in the \ac{aec} sector and the use of linked data to improve the performance of \ac{ar} applications. It evolved into a broader research about lightweight viewers with the same need for performance improvements. It would not have been possible without the help and guidance of several people, whom I would like to thank.

Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor Paulus Present and counselors Jeroen Werbrouck and Professor Ruben Verstraeten for their guidance, feedback, and discussions we had throughout the entire process. In particular, I would like to thank Jeroen Werbrouck for his previous courses that sparked my interest in the domain of coding and web development, and for his valuable feedback on the technical aspects of this thesis.

Secondly, I would like to thank Professor Tiemen Strobbe for taking the time to explain the workings of the Qonic viewer, which inspired the developed framework of this thesis. Finally, I would like to thank Hanne den Biesen and Bram van Rooijen for thoroughly proofreading this thesis. Their feedback and comments were invaluable and I am very grateful for their help.
