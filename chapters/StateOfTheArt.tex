\chapter{State of the art}
-> Introduction to the chapter, both tools and existing approaches to create overview of the state of the art
\section{Related Technologies and Tools}
% \subsection{Game Engines and 3D Viewing}
% -> Present as domain of expertise in that field
% \subsubsection{Unity and its capabilities}
% -> Explanation of the software

% -> Highlighting the RAM problem and how it's related to the aec industry

% -> Use cases (model type and size)

% \subsubsection{Limitations for BIM applications}
% \subsubsection{Other game engines and their relevance}

\subsection{Qoniq and LOD Streaming for BIM}
-> Why I chose this one (why special)

-> LOD streaming principle

-> Probably present it as a goal but in the older framework (for effectiveness(esthetics and performance))

In unity, the maximum amount of ram cannot exceed 2Gb\footcite{UnityWebGL}

\subsubsection{Qoniq's approach to LOD streaming}
(T. Strobbe, personal communication, November 25, 2022)
\subsubsection{Advantages and challenges}
\subsubsection{Potential applicability to LDBIM}
