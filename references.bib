   abstract = {Actors in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, Owner and Operation (AECOO) industry traditionally exchange building models as files. The Building Information Modelling (BIM) methodology advocates the seamless exchange of all information between related stakeholders using digital technologies. The ultimate evolution of the methodology, BIM Maturity Level 3, envisions interoperable, distributed, web-based, interdisciplinary information exchange among stakeholders across the life-cycle of buildings. The World Wide Web Consortium Linked Building Data Community Group (W3C LBD-CG) hypothesises that the Linked Data models and best practices can be leveraged to achieve this vision in modern web-based applications. In this paper, we introduce the Building Topology Ontology (BOT) as a core vocabulary to this approach. It provides a high-level description of the topology of buildings including storeys and spaces, the building elements they contain, and their web-friendly 3D models. We describe how existing applications produce and consume datasets combining BOT with other ontologies that describe product catalogues, sensor observations, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices effectively implementing BIM Maturity Level 3. We evaluate our approach by exporting and querying three real-life large building models.},

   abstract = {Abstract This paper highlights and addresses the complexity and challenges involved in visualizing large and detailed Building Information Models (BIM) in real-time. The contribution of the paper is twofold: (a) an in-depth analysis of four commonly used BIM viewers in terms of real-time rendering performance and (b) the development and validation of a prototype BIM viewer specifically designed to allow real-time visualization of large and complex building models. Regarding existing BIM viewers our results show that they all share limitations in their ability to handle large BIMs taken from real-world projects interactively. However, for the same test models our prototype BIM viewer is able to provide smooth real-time performance without sacrificing visual accuracy. By taking advantage of an efficient visibility determination algorithm, our prototype viewer restricts rendering efforts to visible objects only, with a significant performance increase compared to existing BIM viewers as a result.},

@report{Johansson2009,
   abstract = {A Building Information Model (BIM) is a powerful concept, since it allows both 2D-drawings and 3D-models of buildings or facilities to be extracted from the same source of data. Compared to a general 3D-CAD model a BIM is a different kind of representation, since it defines not only geometrical data but also information regarding spatial relations and semantics. However, because of the large number of individual objects and high geometric complexity, 3D-data obtained from a BIM are not easily used for real-time rendering without further processing. In this paper we present a culling system specifically designed for efficient real-time rendering of BIM's. By utilizing the unique properties of a BIM we can form the required data structures without manual modification or expensive preprocessing of the input data. Using hardware occlusion queries together with additional mechanisms based on specific BIM-data, the presented system achieves good culling efficiency for both indoor and outdoor cases.},

In this survey, we review the fundamental issues in visibility and conduct an overview of the visibility culling techniques developed in the last decade. The taxonomy we use distinguishes between point-based and from-region methods. Point-based methods are further subdivided into object and image-precision techniques, while from-region approaches can take advantage of the cell-and-portal structure of architectural environments or handle generic scenes.},

@article{Ilozor2012,
   abstract = {In recent years, new technologies have emerged that promise to deliver efficiency, cost savings, and productivity increases to the commercial construction industry; building information modeling (BIM), and integrated project delivery (IPD) are such technologies. The literature is overwhelmingly positive with respect to the potential of BIM and/or IPD, in addition to Partnering – a less formal predecessor to IPD. This conceptual study is a critical review of the technologies, which identifies key benefits/deficiencies within the literature, synthesizes the information with comparative analysis, and conceptualizes a new framework for understanding the technologies and their interactions – the BIM/IPD Integration Model. A preliminary methodological concept for resolution of the problems uncovered is also put forth. Conclusions indicate that further study is needed to better understand the relationship between BIM and/or IPD adoption and project performance measures (e.g., cost, profit, ROI, schedule, safety, relationships, etc.) utilizing rigorous quantitative methods applied to actual project data.},

@article{Bittner2004,
   abstract = {We present a simple but powerful algorithm for optimizing the usage of hardware occlusion queries in arbitrary complex scenes. Our method minimizes the number of issued queries and reduces the delays due to the latency of query results. We reuse the results of occlusion queries from the last frame in order to initiate and schedule the queries in the next frame. This is done by processing nodes of a spatial hierarchy in a front-to-back order and interleaving occlusion queries with rendering of certain previously visible nodes. The proposed scheduling of the queries makes use of spatial and temporal coherence of visibility. Despite its simplicity, the algorithm achieves good culling efficiency for scenes of various types. The implementation of the algorithm is straightforward and it can be easily integrated in existing real-time rendering packages based on common hierarchical data structures.},
