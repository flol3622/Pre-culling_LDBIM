   abstract = {The exchange of building data involves both geometric and non-geometric data. A promising Linked Data approach is to embed data from existing geometry formats inside Resource Description Framework (RDF) literals. Based on a study of relevant specifications and related work, this toolset-independent approach was found suitable for the exchange of geometric construction data. To implement the approach in practice, the File Ontology for Geometry formats (FOG) and accompanying modelling method is developed. In a proof-of-concept web application that uses FOG, is demonstrated how geometry descriptions of different existing formats are automatically recognised and parsed.},

  abstract     = {Sharing building information over the Web is becoming more popular, leading to advances in describing building models in a Semantic Web context. However, those descriptions lack unified approaches for linking geometry descriptions to building elements, derived properties and derived other geometry descriptions. To bridge this gap, we analyse the basic characteristics of geometric dependencies and propose the Ontology for Managing Geometry (OMG) based on this analysis. In this paper, we present our results and show how the OMG provides means to link geometric and non-geometric data in meaningful ways. Thus, exchanging building data, including geometry, on the Web becomes more efficient.},

@article{bcfOWL,
   abstract = {The BIM Collaboration Format (BCF) is a buildingSMART standard used to exchange issues in a digital model between heterogeneous software applications and planners. Although the BCF issues are spatially located in a model and provide links to building elements, the format is only loosely connected to the actual BIM model. While the format is well suited for its original use case, it lacks the flexibility to retrieve information from the BCF in conjunction with the BIM model. In this paper, we introduce the BIM Collaboration Format Ontology (bcfOWL), which translates the format to the Semantic Web and harnesses the expressive richness of OWL. We present the structure of the ontology and highlight the differences with existing implementations of BCF. Using example queries, we show how extended relationships between a BIM model and BCF information are enabled by bcfOWL. We show that by transferring BCF to Linked Data, the format's applicability is enhanced without losing compatibility with existing implementations and workflows. In doing so, the ontology aims to integrate into the Linked Building Data environment and facilitates access to synergies between heterogeneous building data.},
