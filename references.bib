   abstract = {Over the last years, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been increasingly adopted in building projects for its benefits to collaboration and associated risk mitigation. Recent work is trying to make this data available over the web (web-based BIM applications). Most notable in making building data web-ready is the Linked Building Data (LBD) initiative. This group has worked on a number of vocabularies and ontologies, thereby starting from a linked data approach (RDF graphs), aiming at representing building data on the web. Yet, a platform is needed that allows to manage the available linked building data, including 3D geometric visualisation, which is the topic of this article: a LBD server. The LBD server is a web-based application which allows users to upload building data and visualise their geometric representation in a graphical user interface, thereby also enabling to link to this data.},

   abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) allows the real and digital worlds to converge and overlap in a new way of observation and understanding. The architectural field can significantly benefit from AR applications, due to their systemic complexity in terms of knowledge and process management. Global interest and many research challenges are focused on this field, thanks to the conjunction of technological and algorithmic developments from one side, and the massive digitization of built data. A significant quantity of research in the AEC and educational fields describes this state of the art. Moreover, it is a very fragmented domain, in which specific advances or case studies are often described without considering the complexity of the whole development process. The article illustrates the entire AR pipeline development in architecture, from the conceptual phase to its application, highlighting each step’s specific aspects. This storytelling aims to provide a general overview to a non-expert, deepening the topic and stimulating a democratization process. The aware and extended use of AR in multiple areas of application can lead a new way forward for environmental understanding, bridging the gap between real and virtual space in an innovative perception of architecture.},

   abstract = {The operation and maintenance (O&M) of buildings and infrastructure represent a strategic activity to ensure they perform as expected over time and to reduce energy consumption and maintenance costs at the urban and building scale. With the increasing diffusion of BIM, IoT devices, and AI, the future of O&M is represented by digital twin technology. To effectively take advantage of this digital revolution, thus enabling data‐driven energy control, proactive maintenance, and predictive daily operations, it is vital that smart building management exploits the opportunities offered by the extended reality (XR) technologies. Nevertheless, in consideration of the novelty of XR in the AECO sector and its rapid and ongoing evolution, knowledge of the specific possibilities and the methods of integration into the building process workflow is still piecemeal and sparse. With the goal to bridge this gap, the article presents a thorough review of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) technologies and applications for smart building operation and maintenance. After defining VR, AR, and MR, the article provides a detailed review that analyzes, categorizes, and summarizes state‐of‐the‐art XR technologies and their possible applications for building O&M along with their relative advantages and disadvantages. The article concludes that the application of XR in building and city management is showing promising results in enhancing human performance in technical O&M tasks, in understanding and controlling the energy efficiency, comfort, and safety of building and infrastructures, and in supporting strategic decision making for the future smart city.},

   abstract = {Purpose: The possibility of integrating building information in an augmented reality (AR) environment provides an effective solution to all phases of a building's lifecycle. This paper explores the integration of building information modelling (BIM) and AR to effectively visualise building information models in an AR environment and evaluates the currently available AR tools. Design/methodology/approach: A BIM model of a selected office room was created and superimposed to the actual physical space using two different AR devices and four different AR applications. The superimposing techniques, accuracy and the level of information that can be visualised were then investigated by performing a walk-through analysis. Findings: From the investigation, it can be concluded that model positioning can be inaccurate depending on the superimposing method used and the AR device. Moreover, using the currently available techniques, only static building information can be superimposed and visualised in AR, showing a need to integrate data from Internet of Things (IoT) sensors into the current BIM-AR processes to allow visualisation of accurate and high-quality operational building information. Originality/value: A practical process and method for visualising and superimposing BIM models in an AR environment have been described. Recommendations to improve superimposing accuracy are provided. The assessment of type, quality and level of detail that can be visualised indicates the areas that need improvement to increase the effectiveness of building information's visualisation in AR.},

   abstract = {Actors in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, Owner and Operation (AECOO) industry traditionally exchange building models as files. The Building Information Modelling (BIM) methodology advocates the seamless exchange of all information between related stakeholders using digital technologies. The ultimate evolution of the methodology, BIM Maturity Level 3, envisions interoperable, distributed, web-based, interdisciplinary information exchange among stakeholders across the life-cycle of buildings. The World Wide Web Consortium Linked Building Data Community Group (W3C LBD-CG) hypothesises that the Linked Data models and best practices can be leveraged to achieve this vision in modern web-based applications. In this paper, we introduce the Building Topology Ontology (BOT) as a core vocabulary to this approach. It provides a high-level description of the topology of buildings including storeys and spaces, the building elements they contain, and their web-friendly 3D models. We describe how existing applications produce and consume datasets combining BOT with other ontologies that describe product catalogues, sensor observations, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices effectively implementing BIM Maturity Level 3. We evaluate our approach by exporting and querying three real-life large building models.},

   abstract = {With the use of Building Information Models (BIM), realtime 3D visualizations have become a natural tool in order to communicate ideas and share information between all involved parties in a project. Currently, several different BIM viewers are available for the purpose of interactive presentations and design reviews. However, as BIMs become larger and more detailed, it provides a challenge for available software solutions to manage them interactively. In this paper we present our findings from analyzing three commonly used BIM viewers - Tekla BIMSight, Autodesk Navisworks and Solibri Model Viewer - in terms of real-time rendering performance. In addition we have developed a prototype BIM viewer to test modern approaches for efficient real-time rendering. Specifically, we have implemented the latest version of the Coherent Hierarchical Culling algorithm. Our results show that existing BIM viewers all share limitations in their ability to handle large and complex BIMs interactively. However, for the same test models, our prototype BIM viewer enables smooth real-time performance with no visual artifacts. The results from our tests thus shows that the technology to enable correct real-time rendering of large and complex BIMs is already accessible, but are currently not utilized by any of the tested BIM viewers.},

A promising Linked Data approach is to embed data from existing geometry formats inside Resource Description Framework (RDF) literals. Based on a study of relevant specifications and related work, this toolset-independent approach was found suitable for the exchange of geometric construction data. To implement the approach in practice, the File Ontology for Geometry formats (FOG) and accompanying modelling method is developed. In a proof-of-concept web application that uses FOG, is demonstrated how geometry descriptions of different existing formats are automatically recognised and parsed.},

The official IFC documentation and BIM requirement checking use cases are used to drive the development of the proposed functionality. By extending these functions, we aim to 1) simplify writing queries and 2) enhance query abilities to retrieve useful information implied in 3D geometry data according to requirement checking use cases. Extended functions are modelled as RDF vocabularies and classified into groups for further extensions. We combine declarative rules with procedural programming to implement extended functions. Real use cases and building models are used to demonstrate the value of this approach and indicate query performance. Compared with query techniques developed in the conventional Building Information Modeling domain, we show the added value of such approach by providing an extended application example of querying building and regulatory data, where spatial and logic reasoning can be applied and data from multiple sources are required. Based on the development, we discuss the applicability of proposed approach, current issues and future challenges.},

The contribution of the paper is twofold: (a) an in-depth analysis of four commonly used BIM viewers in terms of real-time rendering performance and (b) the development and validation of a prototype BIM viewer specifically designed to allow real-time visualization of large and complex building models. Regarding existing BIM viewers our results show that they all share limitations in their ability to handle large BIMs taken from real-world projects interactively. However, for the same test models our prototype BIM viewer is able to provide smooth real-time performance without sacrificing visual accuracy. By taking advantage of an efficient visibility determination algorithm, our prototype viewer restricts rendering efforts to visible objects only, with a significant performance increase compared to existing BIM viewers as a result.},

   abstract = {A Building Information Model (BIM) is a powerful concept, since it allows both 2D-drawings and 3D-models of buildings or facilities to be extracted from the same source of data. Compared to a general 3D-CAD model a BIM is a different kind of representation, since it defines not only geometrical data but also information regarding spatial relations and semantics. However, because of the large number of individual objects and high geometric complexity, 3D-data obtained from a BIM are not easily used for real-time rendering without further processing. In this paper we present a culling system specifically designed for efficient real-time rendering of BIM's. By utilizing the unique properties of a BIM we can form the required data structures without manual modification or expensive preprocessing of the input data. Using hardware occlusion queries together with additional mechanisms based on specific BIM-data, the presented system achieves good culling efficiency for both indoor and outdoor cases.},
