\mespeaks What is linked data?
\gptspeaks Linked data is a way of representing and sharing data on the internet so that it can be easily linked to related data and more easily used by machines. This is achieved by using standardized formats and protocols, such as RDF (Resource Description Framework), which allows data from different sources to be connected and used together. The goal of linked data is to create a web of interconnected data that can be easily accessed and used by anyone, with the ultimate aim of enabling people and machines to better understand the world around them.
\mespeaks What are the opportunities for the AEC industry?
The AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) industry has many opportunities to benefit from linked data. For example, linked data can be used to more easily share and integrate data from different sources, such as building information models (BIM) and GIS (geographic information systems), which can help improve collaboration and decision-making among different stakeholders in a construction project. Linked data can also be used to create more accurate and detailed models of buildings and infrastructure, which can help improve the design and planning of projects. Additionally, linked data can be used to create more comprehensive and accessible datasets that can be used for research and analysis, helping to drive innovation and progress in the AEC industry.
\mespeaks Will the ifc format still have a future?
